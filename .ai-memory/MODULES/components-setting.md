# components/setting

## Purpose

Component module for setting UI and feature concerns.

## Business Purpose

Supports Brancy setting workflows or shared UI.

## Responsibilities

Owns the folder/module concerns described by its file tree and exports.

## Architecture

Follows existing Next/React/TypeScript project conventions.

## Folder Structure

components/setting/.

## Execution Flow

Execution starts from imports, route rendering, or helper calls depending on the module.

## Data Flow

Data enters through props, Next route params, session state, browser state, or backend API responses.

## Dependencies

See imports in related files and dependency docs.

## Reverse Dependencies

Used by routes, components, helpers, or build tooling where imported.

## Public APIs

Exports are defined by source files in the module.

## Internal APIs

Local helpers and non-exported functions stay module-private.

## Classes

No class inventory was generated for this module during initialization unless listed in related files.

## Functions

See related source files for exported functions and local helpers.

## Components

React components are present when the folder contains `.tsx` UI files.

## Hooks

React hooks are present when named `use*` functions/files exist.

## Utilities

Utility functions live in local files where applicable.

## Services

Service integration happens through helper APIs or route handlers when applicable.

## Providers

Providers are documented where the module defines React providers.

## Repositories

No repository pattern implementation was discovered in this module.

## Types

Types are in local files or shared `models/` and `types/`.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are in local files or shared `models/interfaces.ts`.

## Enums

Enums are in local files or shared `models/enums.ts`.

## Configuration

Configuration is local to the folder unless documented in `CONFIGURATIONS.md`.

## Database Usage

No local database objects were discovered. Data persists through external backend APIs where applicable.

## State Management

Mostly React local state, context, NextAuth session, or external state from backend APIs.

## External Integrations

External services are accessed through Brancy backend APIs unless this module documents another integration.

## Security

Do not expose tokens, secrets, or user data. Follow auth and redirect rules.

## Permission Rules

Use `RoleAccess`, session permission flags, and backend authorization where relevant.

## Performance

Keep renders and network calls scoped; avoid unnecessary broad fetches.

## Caching

PWA, Next, browser, or backend caching applies only where configured.

## Environment Variables

No module-specific env vars documented unless related files read them.

## Related Files

The sub-admin activity history and partner phone details render country flags from the existing `/public/Flag/{COUNTRY_CODE}.svg` assets, using normalized two-letter country codes and alternative text on the image.

## Related Modules

Parent module: `components`.

## Known Issues

The general System settings component initializes language controls in English and synchronizes the stored browser language after mount, preserving hydration consistency with the global i18n initialization.

## Technical Debt

Needs deeper per-feature enrichment during future work.

## Future Improvements

Add examples, endpoint schemas, and diagrams when this module is changed.
