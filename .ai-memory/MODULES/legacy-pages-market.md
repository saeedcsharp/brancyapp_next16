# legacy-pages/market

## Purpose

Legacy page module for market routes and workflows.

## Business Purpose

Preserves existing Brancy market feature behavior during App Router migration.

## Responsibilities

Owns the folder/module concerns described by its file tree and exports.

## Architecture

Follows existing Next/React/TypeScript project conventions.

## Folder Structure

legacy-pages/market/.

## Execution Flow

Execution starts from imports, route rendering, or helper calls depending on the module.

## Data Flow

Data enters through props, Next route params, session state, browser state, or backend API responses.

## Dependencies

See imports in related files and dependency docs.

## Reverse Dependencies

Used by routes, components, helpers, or build tooling where imported.

## Public APIs

Exports are defined by source files in the module.

## Internal APIs

Local helpers and non-exported functions stay module-private.

## Classes

No class inventory was generated for this module during initialization unless listed in related files.

## Functions

See related source files for exported functions and local helpers.

## Components

React components are present when the folder contains `.tsx` UI files.

## Hooks

React hooks are present when named `use*` functions/files exist.

## Utilities

Utility functions live in local files where applicable.

## Services

Service integration happens through helper APIs or route handlers when applicable.

## Providers

Providers are documented where the module defines React providers.

## Repositories

No repository pattern implementation was discovered in this module.

## Types

Types are in local files or shared `models/` and `types/`.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are in local files or shared `models/interfaces.ts`.

## Enums

Enums are in local files or shared `models/enums.ts`.

## Configuration

Configuration is local to the folder unless documented in `CONFIGURATIONS.md`.

## Database Usage

No local database objects were discovered. Data persists through external backend APIs where applicable.

## State Management

Mostly React local state, context, NextAuth session, or external state from backend APIs.

## External Integrations

External services are accessed through Brancy backend APIs unless this module documents another integration.

## Security

Do not expose tokens, secrets, or user data. Follow auth and redirect rules.

## Permission Rules

Use `RoleAccess`, session permission flags, and backend authorization where relevant.

## Performance

Keep renders and network calls scoped; avoid unnecessary broad fetches.

## Caching

PWA, Next, browser, or backend caching applies only where configured.

## Environment Variables

No module-specific env vars documented unless related files read them.

## Related Files

legacy-pages/market/.

## Related Modules

Parent module: `legacy-pages`.

## Known Issues

No confirmed module-specific issue recorded at initialization.

## Technical Debt

Needs deeper per-feature enrichment during future work.

## Market Properties Dot Menu

The market properties shortcut menu sends the selected shortcut ID directly with each action. Link-card clicks do not bubble to the surrounding `pinContainer` outside-click handler, preventing that handler from immediately replacing the selected ID with the `1000` sentinel.

MyLink `GetMyLink` responses provide product cards and coupons under the required `shopperInfo` object. The page maps `shopperInfo.products` to the existing product section and passes every entry in `shopperInfo.productCoupons` alongside it for coupon presentation.

## Future Improvements

Add examples, endpoint schemas, and diagrams when this module is changed.
